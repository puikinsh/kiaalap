# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kiaalap Education Management Dashboard are documented in this file.

## Project Evolution Overview

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-30 (Polish & Optimization)

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

#### Mailbox System Enhancements
- **Enhanced Card Styling**: Updated all mailbox pages with consistent Bootstrap 5 card padding
  - Added `shadow-sm` class for subtle elevation
  - Standardized padding: `p-4` on card bodies (24px), `p-3` on headers/footers (16px)
  - Added `border-bottom` and `border-top` classes for visual separation
  - Files updated: `mailbox.html`, `mailbox-view.html`, `mailbox-compose.html`
- **Improved Visual Consistency**: Mailbox cards now match dashboard card styling across all pages

#### Authentication Pages Cleanup
- **Standalone Auth Pages**: Converted authentication pages to pure standalone HTML
  - Removed unnecessary Handlebars partials (sidebar, header, footer)
  - Pages now only contain authentication forms and essential content
  - Files updated: `login.html`, `register.html`, `lock.html`, `password-recovery.html`
- **Cleaner User Experience**: Auth pages load faster without dashboard chrome

### 🧹 Codebase Cleanup

#### Legacy Asset Removal
- **Removed Unused Folders**: Deleted ~1.5-2MB of legacy assets
  - `fonts/` folder (1.3MB) - Legacy FontAwesome, Glyphicons, custom icon fonts
  - `img/` folder - Unused image assets (blog, courses, profile, student, etc.)
  - `pdf/` folder - Unused sample PDF file
- **Asset Preservation**:
  - Moved `favicon.ico` to project root (18KB)
  - Preserved `logo.png` to `public/images/` for future branding use (2.9KB)
- **Result**: Cleaner project structure, faster repository cloning, reduced deployment size

### 📦 Package Updates
- **Version Bump**: Updated package.json version from 1.0.0 → 2.1.0
- **Description Update**: Enhanced package description for better clarity

### 📚 Documentation Improvements

    └── images/
        └── logo.png  # Preserved for branding
```

#### Code Quality
- Maintained consistency across all mailbox pages
- Ensured Bootstrap 5 best practices in card components
- Cleaned up authentication pages for better maintainability

### 📊 Performance Impact
- **Repository Size**: Reduced by ~1.5-2MB
- **Clone Time**: Faster initial repository clone
- **Build Performance**: Slightly improved due to fewer files to process
- **Runtime**: No impact (removed assets were already unused)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed inconsistent padding in mailbox card components
- Resolved authentication pages loading unnecessary dashboard components

### 🔄 Migration Notes
For users upgrading from v2.0.0:
1. Run `npm install` to ensure latest package.json is synced
2. If using custom authentication flows, verify standalone auth pages work correctly
3. If referencing old `fonts/`, `img/`, or `pdf/` folders, update paths:
   - Favicon: Now at `/favicon.ico`
   - Logo: Now at `/public/images/logo.png`
